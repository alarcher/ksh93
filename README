This is a package root directory $PACKAGEROOT. Source and binary
packages in this directory tree are controlled by the command

	bin/package

Binary files may be in this directory or in the install root directory

	INSTALLROOT=$PACKAGEROOT/arch/`bin/package`

For more information run

	bin/package help

Many of the packaged commands self-document via the --man and --html
options; those that do have no separate man page.

Each package has its own license file

	lib/package/LICENSES/<prefix>

where <prefix> is the longest matching prefix of the package name.
At the top of each license file is a URL; the license covers all
software referring to this URL. For details run

	bin/package license [<package>]

A component within a package may have its own license file

	lib/package/LICENSES/<prefix>-<component>

or it may have a separate license detailed in the component
source directory.

Many of the commands self-document via the --man and --html
options; those that do have no separate man page.

Any archives, distributions or packages made from source or
binaries covered by license(s) must contain the corresponding
license file(s).
